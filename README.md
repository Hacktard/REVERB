# REVERB
A site made for the sole purpose of sharing music that is mainly influenced by Electro Music. 

###GENRES
This site is divided into 4 genres namely trap music, deephouse, dubstep, and progressive house.

###IDEA FOR A CUSTOMIZED PLAYER

I am planning to make a custom player for this site that would look a bit influenced by the designs of SoundCloud and Youtube. It may sound a bit cheesy right now but well, this idea is still in progress from becoming a myth to rigid reality.

###BUGS AND OTHER ISSUES

If anyone finds any kind of issues with my code, or has a better alternative for my scripts(eg. Search Algorithm, Random Algorithm etc.) may feel free to tell me about them. 

###FEEDBACK 

The reader may feel free to tell me how my project really is. I am making it open-source for such purposes only to introduce the whole world to my ideas and plans that I personally have.
